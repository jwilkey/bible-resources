  For we ourselves were once foolish,
  disobedient,
  led astray,
  slaves to various passions and pleasures,
  passing our days in malice and envy,
  hated by others and hating one another.
  But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared,
  he saved us,
  not because of works done by us in righteousness,
    but according to his own mercy,
  by the washing of regeneration
    and renewal of the Holy Spirit,
  whom he poured out on us richly
    through Jesus Christ our Savior,
