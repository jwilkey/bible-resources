    if anyone is above reproach,
    the husband of one wife,
    and his children are believers
    and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination.

    For an overseer,
    as God's steward,
    must be above reproach.
    He must not be arrogant
    or quick-tempered
    or a drunkard
    or violent
    or greedy for gain,

    but hospitable,
    a lover of good,
    self-controlled,
    upright,
    holy,
    and disciplined.

    He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught,
    so that he may be able to give instruction
    in sound doctrine
    and also to rebuke those who contradict it.
