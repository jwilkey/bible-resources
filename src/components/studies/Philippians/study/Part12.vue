    <h3>Primer</h3>
    <p class="m2-bottom">Imagine this: you are on a beach in a beautiful bay, sitting comfortably in a chair. The sun is shining, and the temperature is perfect. There is the occassional light breeze. You see the soft foam of the waves as they gently break along the shore. There are tree covered hills on the opposite side of the bay and you see 2 white birds gliding through the sky. You breathe in deeply and smell the bitter odor of a hairy man sitting next you. It is like a damp rag that has been sitting for months in a musty corner of the garage. You get up to move and notice that your feet are stuck in black, thick tar. A screaming boy then knocks over a bucket of grimy water and now you are being swarmed by mosquitos... are you satisfied?</p>

      <p><span>8</span> Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. <span>9</span> What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me — practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.</p>

      <p><span>10</span> I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. <span>11</span> Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. <span>12</span> I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. <span>13</span> I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</p>
