    <p class="marginb">Pray, asking God to give you spiritual understanding through His Spirit</p>

    <h3>Primer</h3>
    <p>Think about a time that someone did something for you that made you thankful for them. How did you express your gratitude, both inwardly and outwardly?</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="hi-left padl marginb">As we read through the passage, let's look at what we learn about the key persons. In a New Testament letter, the key persons will usually be the author, the audience, and God.</p>

    <h3>Read</h3>
    <p>Philippians 1:1-11</p>
    <ul class="questions">
      <li>What do we learn about the author of Philippians?</li>
      <li class="subq">which of these things do you think is least important for us to know about the author? Why?</li>
      <li>What do we learn about the audience?</li>
      <li class="subq">which of these things would most affect how they received this letter?</li>
      <li>What do we learn about God?</li>
      <li class="subq">which of these things describe who God is?</li>
      <li class="subq">which of these things describe what God does?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="hi-left padl muted">the follow-up questions about the author and audience are somewhat of "trick questions"; observing facts may seem mundane if we are distracted, but there is something to learn and enjoy from each detail if we are willing.</p>

    <h3>What does it mean...</h3>
    <ul class="questions">
      <li>What are some of the most important things that someone is doing in this passage?</li>
      <li class="subq">for learning purposes, change one of the key verbs to an opposite or very different action; what would result if this were what the Bible said?</li>
      <li>Take a look at Paul's use of the adjective "all". How would the meaning be different if this word is replaced with "some" or "a few"?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To sum it up...</h3>
    <p>What would you say is the author's main point or thesis in this passage?</p>

    <h3>Apply it</h3>
    <ul class="questions">
      <li>What examples from this text can you follow?</li>
      <li class="subq">In specific terms, how might this look in the things you do?</li>
      <li>What feelings and desires from this text could you emulate?</li>
      <li class="subq">It's one thing to imitate behavior, but how can you attain these type desires? (Psalm 51:12)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Listen & Sing</h3>
    <p>Love, Knowledge & Discernment (Philippians 1:9-11)</p>
