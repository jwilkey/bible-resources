    <div class="passage p2 m2-bottom font2 border-left-tertiary border-right-tertiary">
    <p><span>12</span> I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. <span>13</span> I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</p>

      <p><span>14</span> Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. <span>15</span> And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. <span>16</span> Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. <span>17</span> Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. <span>18</span> I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. <span>19</span> And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. <span>20</span> To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

      <p><span>21</span> Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you. <span>22</span> All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.</p>

      <p><span>23</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
