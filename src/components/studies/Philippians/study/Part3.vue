    <p class="m2-bottom">Pray, asking God to give you spiritual understanding through His Spirit</p>

    <h3>Primer</h3>
    <p>Describe a time when you faced challenge or hardship that had positive or helpful side effects. If this is hard to recall, think of a time that was hard for you; what have you learned from that experience? What did others learn from your experience?</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="hi-left p2-left m2-bottom">As we read through the passage, let's look at what we learn about God. Let's also pay attention to causes and effects that we see in this portion of Paul's letter.</p>

    <h3>Apply it</h3>
    <p><span class="tertiary">Think about it:</span> much of what is being described in this passage has to do with Christians spreading the Gospel of Jesus, especially in the face of persecution. According to Paul in v14, "most" of the Christians were speaking God's word without fear.</p>
