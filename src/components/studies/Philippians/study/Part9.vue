      <h3>Interpret</h3>
      <p>What is Paul implying? In the empty spaces to the right of each phrase of Scripture, write a phrase that represents a contrasting idea from what Paul is saying; for example, "join in imitating me" contrasts with "imitating a non-Christian leader".</p>

    <div class="apply">
      <h3>Application</h3>
      <p class="tertiary font-1">From the application activity SPACE, specifically "Examples to follow" and "Promises to claim".</p>
      <p>• Are you imitating Paul? Are you imitating Jesus? In what ways is this going well for you? In what ways is this not going well?</p>
      <p>• Standing firm, in any context, typically requires effort. What is one way that you can stand firm as a citizen of heaven, waiting for your Savior?</p>
