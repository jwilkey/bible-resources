    <h3>Game</h3>
    <p class="m2-bottom">Everyone gets 2 pieces of paper. One piece will have a random phrase on it ('I like books', etc), the other will have some sort of "reaction" (laugh, boo, etc.). Each piece should be numbered from 1 and up. The moderator will draw two numbers from separate cups, this determines who reads their phrase, and who reacts to the phrase (ex. 'I like books' -> 'boo')</p>

    <h3>Primer</h3>
    <p class="m2-bottom">What is something you have done or do in life that elicits a visible response?</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="m2-bottom border-left-tertiary p1-left">Pray, asking God to give you spiritual understanding through His Spirit</p>

    <h3>Read</h3>
    <p class="m2-bottom">Philippians 4:4-7</p>

    <div class="passage p2 m2-bottom font2 border-left-tertiary border-right-tertiary">
      <p><span>4</span> Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. <span>5</span> Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; <span>6</span> do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. <span>7</span> And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</p>

    <div class="m2-bottom">
      <h3>Observe</h3>
      <p>• Underline the prepositions in this passage (words that communicate relationships to nouns; such as 'in', 'to', 'under', 'after', etc.</p>
      <p class="p2-left">- What relationships are these prepositions establishing? (ex. in where are you told to rejoice?)</p>
      <p>• What do we objectively learn about God in this passage?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="m2-bottom">
      <h3>Interpret</h3>
      <p>False Teaching. Change the wording or emphasis in different phrases of the passage such that it communicates a false teaching, or at least less than what it is actually saying. For example, 'love God' could be changed to 'be distantly mindful of God'.</p>
      <p class="p2-left">- How does this clarify what is actually being said?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="apply m2-bottom">
      <h3>Application</h3>
      <p>• Do you always rejoice in the Lord? Why or why not?</p>
      <p>• Does everyone think of you as a reasonable person? Why or why not?</p>
      <p>• What makes it easier for you to make every need known to God by prayer? What makes this difficult?</p>
      <p>• What was the last thing you complained about, whether out loud or in your heart? How could you make that thing know to God by prayer WITH thanksgiving?</p>
