        <h3>What to do (15 minutes)</h3>
        <p>• Everyone sits together. No toys. Turn off TV, radio, distractions. No devices.</p>
        <p>• Intro prayer ("...God, help us to know you... be pleased with our worship of you...</p>
        <p>• Sing a hymn (consider repeating some hymns so they can learn them, but variety is good)</p>
        <p>• Prayer - consider a theme (thankfulness from today, mom's health, something God has done), each child has a turn praying, even the youngest.</p>
        <p>• Pray - "Spirit, help us to understand your Word, and write it on our hearts"</p>
        <p>• Bible reading - read through a Gospel, one section each night</p>
        <p>• Ask - What did you hear in the Scripture reading?</p>
        <p>• Closing prayer</p>
