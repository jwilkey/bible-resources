              Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his
              mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came
              together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.

              And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her
              to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.

              But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord

              ‚ÄúJoseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for
              that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will
              bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save
              his people from their sins.‚Äù
