Take note of pronouns (he, she, I, etc) that refer back to the same person.\n    "

    "display": "<div data-v-2dce0dde=\"\" class=\"activity-title\">Cause &amp; Effect</div> What is described as happening and what does the text say is the result?\n      Explicit cause and effect is the easiest to identify - someone did this, and as a result this happened or that is true. However, be observant of more intricate forms of cause and effect, such as when a single cause has multiple effects or when multiple causes contribute to a single effect. Also, watch for delayed resolution of a cause &amp; effect pairing, such as is often the case in one of Paul’s letters he expands on an idea before concluding his thought. Further, you may encounter passages which contain heavily implied effects or causes which are too obvious to be considered an interpretation of the text; in this case take note of the fact that the pairing you observe is not explicit and consider to what degree they are implied.\n    "

There may also be other persons with significant mention in the text; if so, you may include them in this exercise. List what you learn about each of these persons. As with all observation activities, try your best not to draw conclusions about the persons that are not explicitly stated in the text itself.\n    "

It may help by starting with sentences, commas and other punctuation that marks a break in thought. The goal of this activity is to understand the flow of thought in the text and to help identify complex referencing of ideas. For example, in the sentence, “I came to you to bless you for the ongoing health of you faithful ministry, delivering to you the gift of love,” it may not be immediately clear that both ‘to bless you’ and ‘delivering to you the gift’ are referring back to ‘I came to you to’. As you move each phrase to it’s own line, experiment with indenting these lines to signal the word or phrase it is referring back to.\n    "

As you read the passage, place each word into a group, either a new group by itself, or into a group formed from previous words which are linked or related in some way. It is ok to keep short phrases such as “led astray” or “hated by others” together. You may also place words/phrases into multiple groups.\n    "

It may be helpful to pretend you are building a Bible index that someone might use in order to find Scripture that relates to an arbitrary subject they have questions about. These topics may be derived from important words in the text, or they may be other words that capture the essence of an important phrase or idea reflected in the text. Topics are best if they are a single word, however, using a few words for a topic is allowed.\n    "

For example, you may ask ‘who was Artemas?’, ‘why was Paul at Nicopolis?’, ‘where was Nicopolis?’, and so on. This activity should help you think about and notice details that you may have otherwise overlooked. If you do this activity correctly it should become more an act of meditation than of interrogation, especially as you ask questions like, ‘what are cases of urgent need?’. Also, this interrogation is not for the purpose of trying to find deficiencies in the text itself, there are none, it is what God intended it to be; the goal is to uncover deficiencies in your understanding of what is being said or your knowledge of what God intends for us from this text.\n    "

Optionally add sub-points to each section title that capture the main ideas for that section.\n      You can identify a new section by changes in who/what the text is describing, the use of transition words (for, but, this, because, etc.), or a change in the author’s tone. Think of your section titles as news headlines, short headings that capture the essential message of the text. This activity is meant to help give you “mental hooks” on which to hang the full content of the passage. Feel free to argue with yourself over the location of a new section, doing so may help you think more deeply about what God is actually saying in the text!\n    "

Use words that a 7 year old would understand. Try to emphasize only the main ideas. This activity will help you identify the flow of thought and force you to think about what is really important, as well as what is generally being said (as opposed to getting distracted by a certain word or confusing phrase).\n    "

How does this help clarify what God is actually saying in the passage?\n      Experiment with qualitative and quantitative changes of the text. A qualitative change would be to replace words like ‘good’ with ‘bad’ or ‘kindly’ with ‘cruelly’. A quantitative change affects the amount or scope of what's being described, such as replacing ‘all’ with ‘some’ or ‘everywhere’ with ‘at home’. The point of both approaches is to force you to think more clearly about what is actually being said.\n    "

    "display": "<div data-v-2dce0dde=\"\" class=\"activity-title\">Anti-meaning: Inverse Positivity</div> Replace positive words or phrases with a corresponding negative word or phrase and, vice versa, negative with positive.\n      Often what is being said becomes more clear when you think about what is not being said. For example, “He used cruel words to make me feel small” may be the inverse of “He used loving words to encourage me”. Once you have finished inverting the meaning consider if you can identify other Scripture passages that support or state the inverse; it is important to realize that just because it may be the opposite of what is said, it may still be untrue!\n    "

What words offer the most meaning, clarity, and direction to what is being said. Once you have identified these words, ask questions like these for the top 3: how does this word impact the meaning of the text? What if this word were changed or removed?
