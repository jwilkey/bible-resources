The point of both approaches is to force you to think more clearly about what is actually being said.\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Anti-meaning: Inverse Positivity</div> Replace positive words or phrases with a corresponding negative word or phrase and, vice versa, negative with positive.\n        Often what is being said becomes more clear when you think about what is not being said. For example, “He used cruel words to make me feel small” may be the inverse of “He used loving words to encourage me”. Once you have finished inverting the meaning consider if you can identify other Scripture passages that support or state the inverse; it is important to realize that just because it may be the opposite of what is said, it may still be untrue!\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Anti-meaning: Soften &amp; Sharpen</div> Replace strong words with weaker words and weak words with stronger words. How does this affect the meaning?\n        It can be easy to skim over words without fully appreciating the intensity or delicacy with which they are used. Paying attention to this can aid in determining the importance of what is being said, and in distinguishing major ideas from minor points.\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Importance</div> What are the important words in this passage? Identify 5-10 of the most important words in the text and rank them in order of importance. Why are they important?\n        This activity is concerned with identifying the words that are important from the perspective of God’s meaning, not merely what stands out to you at this particular time. What words offer the most meaning, clarity, and direction to what is being said. Once you have identified these words, ask questions like these for the top 3: how does this word impact the meaning of the text? What if this word were changed or removed? How else is this word used in the Bible? How might cultural uses of this word affect how this passage is interpreted?\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Related Scripture</div> What other passages talk about similar themes and ideas?\n        List the passages and in what ways they are similar.\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2 class=\"callout alt\">APPLY</h2>\n    <div class=\"small-pad theme-mid rounded shadow\">\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Church</div> What implications does this passage have for you as a church member, for your fellow church family, for the church in your city/region?\n        What would it look like for you to be a living example of this text in your church? To what degree are you this example now?\n        To what degree is your church an example of this passage now? What would it look like for the members of the church you belong to to be a living example of this text?\n        How would it affect your city if churches there were living examples of this text? To what degree are they this example now?\n        Pray. Concerning numerals II and III above, (a) thank God for any ways the church is a godly example. (b) Ask God for His power of regeneration in the areas the church is not the example it should be. (c) Ask God to show you how He would have you contribute to the continuance of a godly example and (d) to the solution for any deficient example.\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Stewardship</div> What implications does this passage have on how you steward your time, money, thoughts and relationships?\n        Set the context for this activity by answering the following questions: In the next 3 days…\n        … What will you spend time doing?\n        … For what will you spend money?\n        … What attitudes and ideas will you think about?\n        … Who will you see and interact with?\n        Now read the passage again. Finally, answer: How should this passage affect...\n        … the way you spend your time?\n        … the way you spend your money?\n        … the things you feel and think?\n        … the way you interact with people?\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">SPACE</div> As you read the passage, what does Spirit reveal in the following areas:\n        Sin I need to confess\n        Promises I can claim\n        Action I need to take\n        Commands I must obey\n        Examples I can follow\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">ACTS</div> This is an acronym and is primarily an activity of prayer. Consider the primer questions for each word in the acronym, then direct your thoughts toward God in prayer:\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Adoration</div> what does this passage teach about God’s character or attributes? Praise God for these qualities.\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Confession</div> what specific or general sinfulness does Spirit reveal in your life through this passage? Confess this to God, accept His forgiveness and power to change.\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Thankfulness</div> how does this passage reveal things you can be thankful for? Thank God for these things.\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Supplication</div> how are you or someone you know in need? Ask God to supply His deliverance in these things.\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Outward-Inward</div> This activity is meant to help you think honestly about differences in who you are to others, in your habits, in your values and in your inner self.\n        Observe the different character qualities in the text. For each question below, you are being measured in 2 ways: (1) to what degree you are an example of each character quality, and (2) to what degree you are relying on yourself versus relying on Spirit for this character quality.\n        If your family were to compare you to these qualities, how would they measure you? Your co-workers, neighbors, etc.?\n        How would you measure your actual habits and behaviors compared to these qualities?\n        How would you measure your values and beliefs compared to these qualities?\n        How would you measure your actual thoughts and desires compared to these qualities?\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">I am &amp; I am not</div> What is happening in this text? What is commanded or modeled? How are you doing these things? How are you not doing these things? What is Jesus making you in regards to these things?\n        When thinking about this passage, and being honest with myself:\n        I am…  (being unfruitful by…)\n        I am not… (being unfruitful by…)\n        Jesus is doing this in my life… (helping me to be fruitful by…)\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"activity theme-mid small-pad muted-more-bottom\">\n        <div class=\"activity-title\">Will, Intellect &amp; Fantasy</div> To what degree have the truths in this passage settled in to who you are?
